# Array-sorting
> The project is about sorting Arrays in according to ascending and descending orders using three different algorithms two simple sorting Techniques and one advanced sorting > technique  The code can operate in 8086 processor which has 16-bit Architecture  and use model small and stack. firstly, the program asks the user to enter the number of elements, > then the program asks him to enter the values of numbers. then the program asks the user to choose the sorting method from three different algorithms (bubble sort , selection > sort, quick sort )
